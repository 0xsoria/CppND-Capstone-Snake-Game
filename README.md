# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application or extend this Snake game, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

## Rubric Points

#### Compiling and Testing
Project compiles and run. Check `Basic Build Instructions section to build the project`.

#### Loops, Functions, I/O
The project code is clearly organized into functionsa and classes. Functions uses loops when necessary and I/O to control the snake.
Example: `Timer` class, `RunTimer` function;

#### Object Oriented Programming
The project is organized into classes, uses classes methods to perform tasks, contains destructors, encapsulation, templates and more. Classes have public and private members when necessary;
- Example: `Game` and `Timer` classes (And all the others);

#### Memory Management
The project makes use of references in function declarations and constructors. Both references and pointers used all around the project.
- Example: `Game` class constructor and class;

#### Concurrency
Project uses a secondary thread for the 10 seconds timer and restart this timer once the snake eats a food or decrease 2 seconds once the snake eats a poisoned food.
Example: `Timer` class, `StartTimer` function;

## Explaining my version of the game
- The game has a 10 seconds timer, if you don't eat any food during this time, the snake dies;
- Poisoned food will appear in the screen, each poisoned food the snake eats, it will decrease the timer in 2 seconds and make the snake run slower;
